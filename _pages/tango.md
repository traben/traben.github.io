I dance tango! I also teach, DJ, and take photos at events. Since I've been in DC I have been occasionally teaching with [Fabrica Tango](https://www.fabricatango.com/our-team). 
If you are in the DC area and are interested in tango I suggest you check out the [Capital Tangueros Calendar](https://sites.google.com/site/dctangocalendar/) which has most of the local regular activity.

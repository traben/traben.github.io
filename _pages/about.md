I'm a senior research associate at Michigan State University working under the direction of Steve Hsu. I'm a staff member in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://directory.natsci.msu.edu/directory/Profiles/Person/102157), but I spend most of my time doing computational biology.  I have undergraduate degrees in mathematics and physics from the University of Michigan, graduate degrees in physics (MS and PhD) under the supervision of prof. Chung-I Tan at Brown University, and previous postdoctoral research experience with prof. Christophe Royon at the University of Kansas. I also designed and taught a course in quantum information theory as a visiting assistant professor at Brown University



Research interests
======
Computational genetics: what can machine/deep learning tell us from genomic data? Interested in developing genetic prediction models for health care and understanding fundamental causal structure of genes.
1. Polygenic Scores (PGS): methods and applications
  - Polygenic Health Index [Widen, Lello, Raben*, et al. SciRep 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22637-8)
  - Sparse genetic architecture [Yong, Raben*, et al. SciRep 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-68881-8)
  - PGS for a variety of phenotypes [Lello, Raben*, et al. SciRep 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-51258-x)
2. Family based analyses of PGS
  - Sibling variation and recombination [Lello, Hsu, Widen, & Raben* SciRep 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27561-z)
  - Sibling applications of PGS [Lello, Raben*, & Hsu SciRep 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69927-7) 
3. PGS in diverse ancestries
  - PGS prediction for biobank scale data [Raben*, et al. SciRep 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37580-5)
  - Biomarker prediction [Widen, Raben*, et al. MDPI 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/12/7/991)

Physics: high energy particle physics and fundamental physics including QCD, non-perturbative physics, conformal field theory, string theory, and lattice models.



News
======
I recently presented a poster at ASHG 2024 about a ["blockLASSO"](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.25.24309482v1) method for fast and cheap polygenic score training. Publication to appear soon.
